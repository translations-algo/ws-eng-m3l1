  <p>Hey! I have been blogging for 2 months now, in which I tell different stories. I go to school, and on Sundays I attend the Algorithmics Visual Programming course.
    I really like making games, cartoons, and recently I got carried away with sites.</p> 
  <p>Read my new posts, I promise to write once a week!</p>
