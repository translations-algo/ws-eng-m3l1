    <p>This summer I went to the sea for the first time; my dream came true. <img src="https://mars.algoritmika.org/uploads/2020/09/blue-309761_640_0_1601486559.png" width="60px" height="20px"></p> 
    <p>Our whole family went to Sochi for ten days. I found beautiful shells on the seashore. <img src="https://mars.algoritmika.org/uploads/2020/09/animal-2030028_640_0_1601486560.png" width="20px" height="20px"/></p>
    <p>In Sochi, we went to the zoo and I saw a turtle. <img src="https://mars.algoritmika.org/uploads/2020/09/turtle-303732_640_0_1601488082.png" width="40px" height="20px"/></p>
    <p>The rest of the vacation I spent at my grandmother's dacha, picking strawberries. <img src="https://mars.algoritmika.org/uploads/2020/09/eat-1299323_640_0_1601486560.png" width="20px" height="20px"/></p>
    <p>A friend visited me at the dacha <img src="https://mars.algoritmika.org/uploads/2020/09/friends-3077835_640_0_1601486560.png" width="20px" height="20px"/> and we fished and played board games.</p>
    <p>I need to go through the photos on my phone. <img src="https://mars.algoritmika.org/uploads/2020/09/image-1271454_640_0_1601486560.png" width="20px" height="20px"/></p>
